Traffic Lights project
- It is a project to simulate the process of 4 traffic lights in a street
- Each 2 traffic lights are green for 9 seconds, Yellow for 2 seconds, and red for 9 seconds ... I count the seconds using timer1 compare mode 
- The passenger can turn the led red to pass the street, but it first turns yellow to alert the cars to stop 
- The project is passed on a layered model also and I used the following drivers:
- GPIO - interrupts - Timer1
